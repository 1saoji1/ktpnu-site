    question: "What if I have no previous tech experience?",
    answer:
      "No previous tech experience is necessary. We look not for experience but for potential which can appear in the form of problem solving, communication, and analytical skills. We are united by our genuine love for technology, so those who are truly passionate about tech and are able to have fun with it are the ones who usually fit in the best. See our Pillars section for more information on the values we place upon our brothers."

  {
    question: "What does the time commitment look like?",
    answer:
      "You can expect to put aside 2-5 hours per week during pledging, and this time commitment decreases after initiation; however, as with all campus organizations, what you get out of KTP depends on what you put into it. We believe that our pledging process is not too strenuous and can be accommodated by most schedules. For further questions regarding KTP's time commitment, contact us."

  {
    question: "What if I can't afford dues?",
    answer:
      "Although we aim to minimize quarterly costs, we offer financial aid for those unable to afford dues. For further questions about finances, contact us."

  {
    question: "Which majors are represented in KTP?",
    answer:
      "Kappa Theta Pi's brothers represent a variety of majors spanning myriad fields in tech. Our majors include but are not limited to Computer Science, Economics, MatSci, Industrial Engienering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and more. While this is our current major demographic, we do not discriminate on majorâ€”we only ask for passion in tech.",
